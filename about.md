# About me
I am computer science student at Rochester Institute of Technology.
<br>
At RIT, I am a member of [Computer Science House](https://csh.rit.edu), a special interest residence floor focused on computing
and group learning.

I enjoy programming in Python, Java, and C. I am a hardcore debian user and really enjoy working on the command line.
